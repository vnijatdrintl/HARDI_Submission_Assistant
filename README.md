# HARDI Submission Assistant

## Project Title:
**HARDI Data Submission Tool**

This project focuses on converting data files in different formats, including Excel, CSV, PDF, and text, to our standard CSV format.

## Authors
- Varis Nijat **D+R International**

## Motivation:
This tool was built in order to cut down our time spent on compiling HARDI distributorsâ€™' monthly data files. It automatically copy and paste all the necessary information from submitted files to designated files. 

This tool should be regularly maintained since we are always recruiting new distributors and some distributors change their file formats sometimes. 

## Prerequisites
- As of now, in order to run the program in your command line you have to install python to you local computer.
- It would be a good idea to make it executable and then share the application with others.
  - I am currently using [Pyintsaller](https://medium.com/dreamcatcher-its-blog/making-an-stand-alone-executable-from-a-python-script-using-pyinstaller-d1df9170e263). 
 
 ## Libraries Used
 - Python Pandas Library
 - Python Tkinter Library
